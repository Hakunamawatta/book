# Using the Godot API

In this chapter, you will learn how to interact with the Godot engine from Rust code. After introducing you to builtins and objects, we will
delve into engine API calls and discuss godot-rust specific idioms surrounding them.

If you are interested in exposing your own Rust symbols to the engine and to GDScript code, check out the chapter
[Registering Rust symbols](../register/index.md). It is however strongly recommended to read this chapter first, as it introduces vital concepts.
