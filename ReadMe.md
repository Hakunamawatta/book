# The godot-rust book

This book is a user guide for **godot-rust**, the Rust bindings to Godot 4.
It covers a large part of the concepts and complements [the API docs][gdext-docs].
There is also [gdnative-book] for Godot 3.

> [!Tip]
> The book is deployed at **[godot-rust.github.io/book][book-web]**.


## Local setup

The book is built with [mdBook] and the plugins [mdbook-toc] and [mdbook-admonish]. To install them and build the book locally, you can run:

```bash
cargo install mdbook mdbook-toc mdbook-admonish
mdbook build
```

To run a local server with automatic updates while editing the book, use:

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```


### Formatting and linting

[markdownlint] enforces a consistent style across the Markdown files.
It is automatically run during CI, but if you have the `npm` toolchain, you can also run it locally:

```bash
npm install --global markdownlint-cli2
./lint.sh

# To fix certain errors directly:
./lint.sh fix
```


### Oxipng

We use [oxipng] to optimize image file size.
You can install it with `cargo install oxipng` and then run it as follows:

```bash
oxipng --strip safe --alpha -r src
```
